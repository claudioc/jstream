jStream
=======

Streaming JS and CSS over WebSockets
-------------------------

Still a POC playing with the idea of a "require.js" over a WS connection, with localStorage caching.

The jstream server is for node.js and the single requirement is sockjs (`npm install sockjs`)

The `index.html` file is the test bed.

Not even alpha quality and the caching part is still missing.
